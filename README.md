# limitedresources
This is a tool created to make it easy to filter through cards graded with the "Limited Resources" podcast.
You can use the Build option to enter your card pool and have the two best colors shown to you.

You can also easily change the sets by changing the variables at the top of the "app.js" file named :
`var mainSet = "";
var setOne = "";
var setTwo = "";`.
